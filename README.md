# problem-of-three-bodies
A simple simulation of the problem of three bodies in C++. 

## Executing the program

You should have installed in your machine `raylib`.

```bash
make
```

```bash
./main
```

### Steps 

1. Render the planets
2. Assume colitions are not possible. Execute the gravitational force formula for each element.
3. Calculate the vectors vx, vy, ax, ay.
4. Render the vector v and a.
5. Move the planets
